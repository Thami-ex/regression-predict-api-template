    "The company is headquartered in Kenya with a team of more than 100 staff, focused on building practical solutions for Africa’s dynamic transportation needs, from developing apps and web solutions, to providing dedicated support for goods on the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently operating in Kenya and Uganda, Sendy is expanding to Nigeria and Tanzania, to enable thousands more businesses to move volumes of goods easily, anywhere, at any time. Sendy aggregates a pool of delivery options from 28 ton, 14 ton, 5 ton trucks to pick up trucks, vans and motorcycles.\n",

    "Sendy Logistics has realised that data is a critical component that can aid in building more efficient, affordable and accessible solutions as such they are interested in using data to predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will help Sendy enhance customer communication and the reliability of its service; which will ultimately improve customer experience. In addition, the solution will enable Sendy to realise cost savings, and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business through improved resource management and planning for order scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help Sendy achieve this goal we will build a predictive model that will predict estimated time of delivery of orders by looking at all factors that could influence the time from pick up to arrival of an order such as distance, date, the rider delivering the order etc."
